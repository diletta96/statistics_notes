# Categorical data: Tbles, bar, charts and pie charts
frequenct table: counts or percentage.
way to visual categorical data:
- Bar chart (frequency vs x or percentage vs x);
- Pie Chart (not recommend)

# Quantitative data: Histograms
Quantitative variables = numerical, we can perform mathematical operions on;
histogram =  quick view of what data looks like;
Four main aspects:
- Shape = overall appearance --> symmetric, bell-shaped; unimodal or polimodal; righ-lft skewed
- Center = mean or median
- Spread = how far data spreads --> Range = max - mim (important for histogra,), Interquartile Range (IQR), standard deviation, varience
- Outliers = data ponts that fall far from the bulk of data

# Quantitavive data: numerical summeries

Numerical summaries are used alongside our graphical representation of data to give a first impression of what data looks like.
Depeding on the software you are using you may get sloightly different numerical summaries.

5 numeber summary:
- Minimum = sammlest value
- 1st Quartile (Q1) or 25th percentile = where 25% of the data falls below that value 
- Median or 50th percentile
- 3rd Quartile (Q3) or 75th percentile
- Max
The IQR= Q3 - Q1 --> simalar to range, but is better use IQR than range when we have righ-left skewed
SD = standard deviation; value of spread --> the avarage distance that our dtaa points fall from the mean value

# Standard score (Empirical rule)
