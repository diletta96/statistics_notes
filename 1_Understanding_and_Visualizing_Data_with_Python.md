# Week 1 - INTRODUCTION TO DATA
##  What is statistics?
It's the subject that encompasses all aspects of learning from data. So, as a methodology, we're talking about the tools, the methods to allow us to work with data to understand that data.
A statistic is a numerical or graphical summary of a collection data (e.i. avarage score on final exam).
The FIELD of STATISTIC is an academic discipline focusing on reasearch methodology.
Data can be overwhelming --> making sanse of data usually involves reduction and summarization
REDUCTION= make dataset comprenhesible
SUMMARIZATION = depends primarily on goals of data cumsumer
Error = indicates the discripance from reality
Summarize data = often focusing on that typical or central value. But it's important to emphaseize on the variation of the data.

FORECASTING or PREDICTION (central task in statistics) --> efficient use of available data can make accuarte predictions about future

There are different accuarcy of the data.
HIGH ACCURACY i.e. age or height
MORE DIFFICULT i.e. blood pressure (varies minute to minute)
HARDER i.e. personality, mood

Statistic: major role in constructing and evaluating rigorous approaches for measuring difficul-to-define concepts and in assesing quality.


## What is data
Data can be :
- numbers
- images
- words
- audio

### Where do data come from
Two key types of data:

- organic/ process data --> generated by a computazied information system or extracted from from viedo or audio recordings. __The common point is that they're generated organically as the result of some process and they're often generated over time.__ e.i. Netflix viewing history or web browser activity or temperature/pollution sensors. Generate massive quantities of data = BIG DATA. The processing required significant computational resouces --> data scientists mine these data to study trends and uncover interesting relationship --> getting the data in a format that's suitable for analysis, that process alone requires very significant resources from a computational perspective. 

- Designed data collection -->  __Specific studies that are designed to specifically address a particular research objective.__  Individuals sampled from a population, interviewed about opitions on a particular topic (specifically designing a sample). Common feature:
    - sampling from populations, administratiion of carefully designed questions
    - typically datasets much smaller compared to organic/process dtaa sets
    - data colleted for a very specific reasons 

Important question: Are the data i.i.d.? __i.i.d.= indipendent and identically distributed data__. All the observations are independent of all the other observations and the values that we're looking at are all arising from some common statistical distribution, that's where the i.i.d terminology comes from.
