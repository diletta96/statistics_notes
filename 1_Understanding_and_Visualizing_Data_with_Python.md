# Week 1 - INTRODUCTION TO DATA
##  what is statistics?
It's the subject that encompasses all aspects of learning from data. So, as a methodology, we're talking about the tools, the methods to allow us to work with data to understand that data.
A statistic is a numerical or graphical summary of a collection data (e.i. avarage score on final exam).
The FIELD of STATISTIC is an academic discipline focusing on reasearch methodology.
Data can be overwhelming --> making sanse of data usually involves reduction and summarization
REDUCTION= make dataset comprenhesible
SUMMARIZATION = depends primarily on goals of data cumsumer
Error = indicates the discripance from reality
Summarize data = often focusing on that typical or central value. But it's important to emphaseize on the variation of the data.

FORECASTING or PREDICTION (central task in statistics) --> efficient use of available data can make accuarte predictions about future

There are different accuarcy of the data.
HIGH ACCURACY i.e. age or height
MORE DIFFICULT i.e. blood pressure (varies minute to minute)
HARDER i.e. personality, mood

Statistic: major role in constructing and evaluating rigorous approaches for measuring difficul-to-define concepts and in assesing quality.
